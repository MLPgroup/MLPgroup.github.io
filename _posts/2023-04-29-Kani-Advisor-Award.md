I (Nickvash Kani) won the **2023 Engineering Council Outstanding Advisors** award. I am so grateful to all of you for your many nominations. I've been truly blessed to be surrounded for so many smart and hard-working individuals and hope that we can all keep working hard and keep winning/publishing even more.
