Our very own Mr. **Hongbo Zheng** has won the **2024 Stanley H. Pierce Faculty Award** for fostering outstanding student-faculty relationships. Additionally, our brother Mr **Vishesh Prasad** won ECE's **Indira Gunda Saladi Engineering Research Prize** for his proposed work on AI methods to summarize math-rich, STEM manuscripts. We are all very proud of them and can't wait to see the many more coming their way.
